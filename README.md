# bikesharingdemandprediction
Built a predictive model to forecast bike rental demand based on various factors like weather conditions, time features, and seasonality.

Key Highlights:

Used the Bike Sharing Dataset (Kaggle) containing hourly/daily rental data.

Performed data preprocessing including handling missing values, feature engineering (e.g., extracting hour, day, season), and encoding categorical variables.

Explored data using visualizations to understand trends and correlations.

Trained and evaluated regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict demand.

Achieved strong model performance and compared results across models.
 Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
